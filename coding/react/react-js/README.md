## ReactJS + Vite Experiment

This project is a playground for experimenting with ReactJS using Vite as the build tool. The main focus is to compare and explore the differences between class-based components and functional components in React.

You will find examples, tests, and error boundary handling for both approaches. Ideal for learning, benchmarking, and understanding React component patterns.
