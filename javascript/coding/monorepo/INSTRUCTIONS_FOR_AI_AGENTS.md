# Interactive Quiz Application - AI Agent Instructions

## Application Overview

**Interactive learning platform** built as a React-based single page application that delivers multiple-choice quiz experiences with intelligent interaction patterns. The application specializes in educational content delivery through an intuitive drag-and-swipe interface optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

IMPORTANT: After any code change, always run these VSCode tasks: "Build Frontend" and "Build Backend"

### Core Educational Purpose

The application serves as a **learning assessment tool** where users progress through course-based question sets with immediate feedback mechanisms. Each incorrect answer triggers educational explanations to reinforce learning concepts, creating an iterative knowledge building experience.

## Business Logic & User Experience

### Learning Flow Architecture

**Primary User Journey:**

1. **Course Selection Hub** - Users browse available educational courses in a grid layout
2. **Quiz Session** - Interactive question-by-question progression with multiple choice answers
3. **Immediate Feedback** - Correct answers advance progression; incorrect answers trigger explanation screens
4. **Completion Analytics** - Final statistics showing accuracy and learning progress

### Question Management System

**Dynamic Question Queue:**

- Questions load from backend course repositories
- Skipped questions automatically requeue at the end for second attempts
- Real-time progress tracking with visible statistics (correct/incorrect/skipped counts)
- Intelligent progression that ensures all content is reviewed

**Answer Validation Logic:**

- Instant feedback on selection with visual confirmation
- Correct answers trigger automatic advancement with smooth transitions
- Incorrect answers pause progression to display educational explanations
- Skip functionality available for challenging questions without penalty

### Educational Reinforcement Pattern

**Explanation System for Learning:**

- Wrong answers trigger detailed explanation screens showing:
  - User's selected answer with clear marking as incorrect
  - Correct answer highlighted and emphasized
  - Conceptual explanation of the underlying topic
  - Specific reasoning why the selected answer was wrong
- Explanations require interaction to continue, ensuring engagement
- Post-explanation continuation returns to question flow at next item

## Technical Architecture Patterns

### Application Structure Philosophy

**Component Hierarchy:**

- **App Shell**: Router configuration with health-checked backend integration
- **Course Hub**: Grid-based course selection with responsive card layouts
- **Quiz Engine**: Main application logic managing state, progression, and user interactions
- **Question Display**: Isolated components for question presentation and option selection
- **Explanation Engine**: Dedicated educational feedback system with detailed content display
- **UI Interaction System**: Unified drag/click/touch interface for seamless cross-platform experience

### State Management Strategy

**Centralized Quiz State:**

- Progress tracking (current question index, completion statistics)
- User interaction state (selected answers, explanation viewing mode)
- UI state management (transitions, animations, loading states)
- Question queue management with dynamic reordering for skipped items

**Session Persistence:**

- Real-time statistics tracking throughout quiz session
- State isolation between different quiz attempts
- Clean state initialization for new course selections

### Cross-Platform Interaction Design

**Unified Input Handling:**

- **Desktop Experience**: Mouse-based clicking with hover feedback and card-style layouts
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-optimized gestures with swipe-to-advance functionality
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support with proper ARIA labeling
- **Responsive Adaptation**: Automatic interface scaling and layout adjustment

**Gesture Recognition System:**

- Intelligent distinction between intentional gestures and accidental touches
- Configurable thresholds for gesture activation vs. passive interaction
- Smooth animation feedback during gesture recognition
- Fallback click handling for non-gesture interactions

## Data Integration & Backend Communication

### Course Content Management

**Dynamic Content Loading:**

- Course metadata retrieval from backend repositories
- On-demand question loading per course selection
- Error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- Loading state management with blocking interfaces during data fetch

**Health Check Architecture:**

- Backend availability verification before application startup
- Automatic retry mechanisms with progressive backoff
- User notification system for connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable

### API Communication Patterns

**Service Layer Design:**

- Centralized backend communication through singleton service pattern
- Standardized error handling across all API interactions
- Loading state propagation to UI components
- Response validation and type safety enforcement

## User Interface Design Philosophy

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Device-Specific Adaptations:**

- **Desktop**: Card-based layouts with shadows, spacing, and hover effects
- **Mobile**: Flat design with full-width layouts and touch-optimized controls
- **Tablet**: Hybrid approach scaling between desktop and mobile patterns
- **Accessibility**: High contrast support, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

**Visual Feedback Systems:**

- Immediate response to user interactions with animation feedback
- Progress indicators showing quiz completion status
- Color-coded answer validation (correct/incorrect/neutral states)
- Smooth transitions between application states and screens

### Navigation and Flow Control

**Seamless Progression:**

- Automatic advancement on correct answers with visual confirmation
- Pause-and-explain pattern for incorrect answers requiring user acknowledgment
- Back navigation to course selection from any quiz state
- Completion celebration with detailed performance analytics

**Scroll and Interaction Management:**

- Automatic scroll-to-top on all state transitions
- Never blocking native scroll functionality
- Gesture area isolation to prevent interference with navigation
- Touch event optimization for responsive feel

## Content and Learning Design

### Question Format Standards

**Multiple Choice Structure:**

- Four-option format (A, B, C, D) with single correct answer
- Clear question text with unambiguous phrasing
- Balanced option distribution to prevent pattern recognition
- Explanation content covering conceptual understanding

**Educational Content Requirements:**

- Explanations must provide conceptual understanding, not just correct answers
- Invalid option reasoning to explain why each wrong answer is incorrect
- Progressive difficulty suitable for educational progression
- Content sourced from structured educational repositories

### Assessment and Analytics

**Learning Progress Tracking:**

- Real-time accuracy calculation and display
- Attempt tracking with skip count visibility
- Completion percentage with question remaining counts
- Final session summary with learning outcome metrics

**Performance Feedback:**

- Immediate validation feedback on answer selection
- Cumulative statistics display throughout session
- Completion celebration with comprehensive performance review
- Encouragement messaging for continued learning engagement

## Quality and Performance Standards

### User Experience Requirements

**Performance Expectations:**

- Instant response to user interactions (sub-100ms)
- Smooth animations and transitions without frame drops
- Quick loading times for course and question data
- Efficient memory usage during extended quiz sessions

**Reliability Standards:**

- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic recovery from temporary network issues
- State preservation during brief connectivity losses
